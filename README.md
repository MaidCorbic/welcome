## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm a passionate graphic and web designer with a strong love for technology and programming.  
I enjoy creating clean, functional, and visually engaging digital experiences.

My core skills include **HTML, CSS, Svelte**, and **Bootstrap** .
I’m constantly exploring new tools and modern workflows to improve both design and performance.


🏃‍♂️ **Runner by Day, Coder by Night**

When I’m not logging miles, you’ll find me to **write poems or meditate**.  
Running has taught me **discipline, consistency, and mental endurance** - values I bring into every project.
